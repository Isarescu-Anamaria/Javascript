              <p>
                The creation of the "Association for the Conservation and Enhancement of the Plitvice Lakes" in 1893 illustrates
                a long history of dedication to the best possible conservation of what today constitutes the World Heritage property. 
                Early conservation efforts were formalized when Plitvice Lakes became a national park in 1949. In 1997, the national 
                park was enlarged on the grounds of protecting the entire catchment area of the lakes and most of the groundwater system.
                Since the extension of the World Heritage property in 2000, the surface area of Plitvice Lakes National Park and the 
                World Heritage property are identical.

                are formed as extension of basic substrates dolomite while Lower Lakes is the limestone canyon that extends into
